Inclusion Criteria
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Similarly to `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/faq.html#what-are-the-inclusion-criteria-for-new-algorithms>`_,
PyPOTS mainly considers well-established models/algorithms for inclusion. A rule of thumb is the paper should be
published for at least 1 year, have 20+ citations, and the usefulness to our users can be claimed.

But we encourage the authors of proposed new models to share and add your implementations into PyPOTS
to help boost research accessibility and reproducibility in the field of POTS modeling.
Note this exception only applies if you commit to the maintenance of your model for at least two years.


Becoming a Maintainer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To become a maintainer of PyPOTS, you should

1. be active on GitHub;
2. watch the repository to receive latest news from it;
3. be familiar with the PyPOTS codebase;
4. and have made at least one pull request merged into branch ``main`` of PyPOTS,
   which is not for fixing typos or improving the docs;
5. join the `PyPOTS community on Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/pypots-org/shared_invite/zt-1gq6ufwsi-p0OZdW~e9UW_IA4_f1OfxA>`_
   and become a member of the channel ``#dev-team``. ``#dev-team`` currently is a public channel, and you don't need an invitation to join it.
6. commit to obey our development principles;

After meeting up with the above conditions,
you can propose to get a maintainer role by dropping an email to `team@pypots.com <mailto:team@pypots.com>`_.
We will review your request and reply to you as soon as possible.
Once you obtain the role, you'll be listed as a member on the ``About Us`` pages of
`PyPOTS main site <https://pypots.com/about/>`_
and
`PyPOTS docs site <https://docs.pypots.com/en/latest/about_us.html>`_.


Our Development Principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. `Do one thing and do it well (Unix philosophy) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well>`_.
   We're PyPOTS: we don't build everything related to time series and we don't have to, but only things related to partially-observed time series.
   And when we build something in PyPOTS, we're responsible and trying our best to do it well;
2. `Eat our own dog food <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food>`_.
   We develop PyPOTS and we should try the best to use it in any scenarios related to POTS data.
   Only in this way, we can figure out how it tastes like, if it is a good toolset for users, and what other features and models should be included into PyPOTS;
