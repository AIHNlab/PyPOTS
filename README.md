⦿ `Motivation`: Due to all kinds of reasons like failure of collection sensors, communication error, and unexpected malfunction, missing values are common to see in time series from the real-world environment. This makes partially-observed time series (POTS) a pervasive problem in open-world modeling and prevents advanced data analysis. Although this problem is important, the area of data mining on POTS still lacks a dedicated toolkit. PyPOTS is created to fulfill this blank, to become a handy toolbox that is going to make data mining on POTS be easy rather than tedious, to help engineers and researchers focus more on the core problems in their hands rather than on how to deal with the missing parts in their data.

⦿ `Mission`: PyPOTS will keep integrating classical and the latest state-of-the-art data mining algorithms for partially-observed multivariate time series. For sure, besides various algorithms, PyPOTS is going to have unified APIs together with a detailed documentation and interactive examples across algorithms as tutorials.

**‼️ PyPOTS is currently under developing. A very first dev version will be released ASAP. If you are looking forward to such a useful tool, please give PyPOTS a star and watch it to keep you posted on its progress. If you have any suggestions or want to recommend any algorithms for PyPOTS to integrate with, please [drop me an email](mailto:wenjay.du@gmail.com) at any time. Thank you for your attention!**
